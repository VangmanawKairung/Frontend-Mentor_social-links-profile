## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Variables)
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design with Media Queries
- Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I’ve learned how to effectively apply Sass for better styling management, especially by using variables and nesting to keep my code organized. I’ve also gained more confidence with Flexbox to handle responsive layouts and centering elements. Using semantic HTML5 elements has improved the structure of my code, making it more accessible. I’ve embraced a mobile-first workflow, ensuring the design adapts well to different screen sizes. Overall, this project has sharpened my front-end skills, particularly in writing clean, scalable, and responsive code.

### Continued development

I would focus on refining my use of responsive design techniques, possibly diving deeper into CSS Grid to complement Flexbox for more complex layouts. I also want to explore advanced Sass features, like mixins and functions, to optimize my code further. Incorporating more accessibility features, such as improved ARIA labeling and keyboard navigation, would make my projects more inclusive. Additionally, experimenting with JavaScript for adding interactivity could be the next step in elevating my front-end skills. There's always room to fine-tune my workflow and efficiency.
